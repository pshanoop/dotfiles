Remove per-device settings from cmdline
Allow spaces in cmdline:
- Use a wrapper script and pass a cmdline.tmp to sbfile.
- Try to upstream the idea somehow.
Should have instructions on /etc/fstab.
- This generates /boot and swap, which is all I need:
- genfstab -U -f /boot  /
Should run `bootctl set-default arch.efi` AFTER the bundle is generated for the
first time. It might make sense to generate it explicily the first time.
