# This file is here to work around a bug in nemo.
# Or rather, a bug in glib, which nemo uses.
#
# When opening files, nemo delegates opening to glib, but glib has some
# hardcoded terminal names, and expect to find one of them.
#
# This is in spite of cinnamon having its own setting for terminals. Hard to
# say which one is at fault here.
#
# See https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon/issues/9255
# and https://github.com/linuxmint/nemo/issues/2399
# 
# Hopefully, this won't confuse applications and make them think this is X11
# (given that xterm is used).
