# This script searches image files in a directory, opens them all with imv and
# sets the first argument to the first image displayed by imv.
#
# Implementation notes: this script is quite slow because of POSIX limitations
# and portability concerns. First calling the shell function 'abspath' is
# quicker than calling 'realpath' because it would fork a whole process, which
# is slow. Second, we need to append a file list to imv, which can only be done
# properly in two ways: arrays (which are not POSIX) or \0 sperated
# strings. Unfortunately, assigning \0 to a variable is not POSIX either (will
# not work in dash and others), so we cannot store the result of listfiles to a
# variable.
