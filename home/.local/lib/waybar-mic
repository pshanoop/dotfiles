# Helper for waybar to show current mic status.
#
# This shows a small icon with the current microphone status in the taskbar. I
# use a global hotkey (Super+M) to control the microphone, so I don't have to
# remember a different muting hotkey for each [web] application. It also makes
# it easier to make sure I'm muted when handling multiple things at once.
#
# Waybar's CSS is set so that an open mic is a RED icon, and it's less flashy
# when the mic is muted.
#
# It might make sense to hide the module if no microphone is unmuted. This
# depends on: https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar/issues/699
#
# TODO: If a non-primary microphone is one, that should somehow be reflected.
