# Brief overview of how this is structured:
#
# - This file contains all global sway settings.
#
# - `keys.conf` has all global keybindings. This includes changing focus,
# moving windows, switching workspaces, resizing, closing, etc.
#
# - `apps.conf` contains keybindings for running common applications, and
# specific per-application settings. Anything that runs external commands is
# here too.
#
# Read `man 5 sway` for a reference on the files' syntax.

# Define these two keys as alias which I understand.
# `Super` is a generic name to the `Cmd` or `Windows` key.
set $super Mod4
set $alt Mod1

# Include all other `.conf` files in the config directory.

# Font for window titles. Will also be used by the bar unless a different font
# is used in the bar {} block below.
# This font is widely installed, provides lots of unicode glyphs, right-to-left
# text rendering and scalability on retina/hidpi displays (thanks to pango).
font pango:Ubuntu 9
# Before i3 v4.8, we used to recommend this one as the default:
# font -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-120-75-75-C-70-iso10646-1
# The font above is very space-efficient, that is, it looks good, sharp and
# clear in small sizes. However, its unicode glyph coverage is limited, the old
# X core fonts rendering does not support right-to-left and this being a bitmap
# font, it doesn’t scale on retina/hidpi displays.
