This repository contains many of my system-level configuration
files. These files are maintained here and then installed over to the
real root directory for maintainability (ie: easier backup/sincronization
and system replication).

Note that this repository **only** contain configuration files that need
to be installed as root. User-level settings are purely handled via git.
See my [dotfiles](https://github.com/hobarrera/dotfiles) repository if
you're interested in those.
