sysconfig
=========

This repository contains many of my system-level configuration
files.  
These files are maintained here and then installed over to the real root
directory for maintainability (ie: easier backup/synchronization and system
replication).

Note that this repository **only** contain configuration files that need
to be installed as root. User-level settings are via [homesick][homesick]
Check out my [dotfiles][dotfiles] repository if you're interested in those.
