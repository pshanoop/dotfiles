My dotfiles
===========

This repository contains a great deal of my dotfiles and configurations, which I backup and sync (between different computers) using git.

I decided to make these public, for three reasons:

 - Some of the applications I use have few examples. Google will surely point users seeking more here.  
 - To share yet another "perfect mutt setup", which uses mutt+offlineimap+notmuch+opensmtpd.
 - The quickly share config files with friends who are curious on how I achieved something.

There's a related "relinker" script (still WIP) that creates symlinks in the proper locations (ie: ~ or ~/.config) to the files inside this repo. This helps keep ``git status`` readable.

Feel free to reuse these files as you see fit. I don't think they even qualify as "software" for them to actually require a license, if you think they do, feel free to reuse them under the terms of the BSD license.
