# ~/.dotfiles

üè° My personal dotfiles (i.e.: user-wide configuration for my systems).

Having a history of config files also allows me to be bolder when experimenting
with new features or setups -- if I find anything breaks, it's very simple to
got back to my previous configuration.

Other uses of this repository include:

- Sync configurations across machines.
- Keep a backup of my configurations.
- Keep old revisions of my configurations. (Duh!)
- Quickly configure new machines. I keep a dump of my installed packages, so
  installing all of them on a new device, and them cloning this repo in should
  be enough to get me up and running!

I use my own script (see `sync.py`) to keep this repository in sync with my
actual dotfiles using symlinks.

## Tools I use

- `sway`: desktop compositor
- `waybar`: system status bar
- `neovim`: code editor (using LSP, tree-sitter, and quite a few plugins)
- `zsh`: shell and main working environment (it's designed for interactive use)
- `alacritty`: very fast OpenGL terminal emulator in Rust
- `darkman`: automatic dark mode based on sundown and sunrise

I try to keep my setup as a reproducible one, so in case of breakage it's
possible to roll back and forth in time between settings.
